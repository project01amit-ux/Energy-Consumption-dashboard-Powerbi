# Energy Consumption Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to visualize and analyze energy consumption patterns.  
The dashboard helps identify peak usage times, track trends, and provide actionable insights for optimizing energy usage.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project uses *Power BI* to transform raw energy usage data into an interactive dashboard with:
- Daily, weekly, and monthly consumption trends
- Peak usage hours identification
- Comparison between different regions/sectors
- Year-over-year usage patterns

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- *Power BI* â€“ Data visualization & interactive reporting
- *Excel / CSV* â€“ Data source
- *DAX* â€“ Measures and calculated columns

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- Energy_Consumption_Dashboard.pbix â†’ Power BI project file
- data/energy_consumption.csv â†’ Sample dataset
- screenshots/ â†’ Dashboard preview images

## ðŸš€ How to View the Dashboard
