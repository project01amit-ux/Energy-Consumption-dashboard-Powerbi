- Daily, weekly, and monthly consumption trends
- Peak usage hours identification
- Comparison between different regions/sectors
- Year-over-year usage patterns

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- *Power BI* â€“ Data visualization & interactive reporting
- *Excel / CSV* â€“ Data source
- *DAX* â€“ Measures and calculated columns
